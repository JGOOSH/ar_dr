# Particle Filter Drift Calculation 

Using our positioning system, we calculated the error (drift) in particle filtering localization

Project was for UT-Austin FRI Autonomous Robotics Stream...

Lab goal was to improve the localization system within the robots...currently Monte Carlo....

Proposed Visual localization through Fiducial Markers

This system localizes the robot based on that

# How to run

# How the system works

# Effectiveness of the system
